 * firstly data will be stored to buffer of the flow controller and be sent to endpoint after a period (an integer multiple of
 * 1s, the exact time depends on bandwidth limitation and buffer size). If the buffer is full, data be will discarded. The
 * capacity of flow controller buffer is 512 bytes.
 * @note Must ensure actual bandwidth is less than bandwidth limitation of corresponding channel or stream, please
 * refer to developer documentation or state of channel/stream for details related to bandwidth limitation. User can
 * get state of "sendDataChannel" command channel via GduLowSpeedDataChannel_GetSendDataState() function. If actual
 * bandwidth exceeds the limitation or busy state is set, the user should stop transmitting data or decrease amount of data
 * to be sent.
 * @note Max size of data package sent to selected channel address end on a physical link of command channel is 128.
 * If the length of data to be sent is greater than 128, data to be sent will be divided into multiple packages to send,
 * and the user will also receive multiple data packages on the selected channel address end.
